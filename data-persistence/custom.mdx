title: Custom Data Layer
---

Literal provides the simplest way to persist, analyze and monitor your data.

If you're considering implementing a custom data layer, check out this example [here](https://github.com/Chainlit/chainlit/blob/main/cypress/e2e/data_layer/main.py) for some inspiration.

Also, we would absolutely love to see a community-led open source data layer implementation and list it here. If you're interested in contributing, please reach out to us on Discord.
