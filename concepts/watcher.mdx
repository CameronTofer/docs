title: Watcher
---
The -w (watch) command line option can be passed to the chainlit run command to enable file watching. 
When this option is specified, the file watcher will be started and any changes to files will cause the server to reload the app, allowing faster iterations.

```bash
chainlit run app.py -w
```
