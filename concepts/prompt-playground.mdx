title: Prompt Playground

As your app grows in complexity (e.g. Chain of Thoughts, LangChain), understanding the process behind generating a specific answer can become challenging.

To help you overcome this issue, Chainlit allows you to easily explore the reasoning process right from the user interface.

Take a look at this screenshot from the [LangChain MRKL](/examples/mrkl) example:

It's evident that several intermediate steps are needed to answer the initial question. Additionally, each step might involve another tool, resulting in a tree-like structure.

Chainlit simplifies this process by enabling you to visualize and navigate through these otherwise complicated reasoning pathways.

While scrolling through the steps in the user interface is useful, having the ability to iterate on the prompt for each step in real-time is even more powerful.

Below each message you will find an `edit button` if that message was generated by a prompt. Clicking on it opens a prompt playground, allowing you to modify and iterate on the prompt as needed:
