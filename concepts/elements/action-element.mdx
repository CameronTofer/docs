title: Action Element
---

Action elements are clickable buttons triggering python function calls. When a user clicks on the button, the according python function is called.

## Usage
You can define a callback for the action by using the `@cl.action` decorator. The callback will be called with the action as the first argument.

```python
import chainlit as cl


@cl.action("action1")
def on_action(action):
    cl.send_message("Executed action 1!")


@cl.on_chat_start
def main():
    cl.send_message("Hello, here is a clickable action!")
    cl.send_action(name="action1", trigger="clickable action",
                   description="Click on this to run action1!")
```

## Result
