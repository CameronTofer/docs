title: Elements Display

Chainlit will automatically check if messages contain references to elements. In the following example, we send an image element and a text element, then send a message referencing both of the elements by name:

```python Code Example
import chainlit as cl

@cl.on_chat_start
def start():
    cl.send_local_image(path="./cat.jpeg", name="image1", display="inline")
    cl.send_text(text="Here is a text element", name="text1", display="inline")

    msg = "Here is image1, a nice image of a cat! As well as text1!"
    cl.send_message(content=msg)
```

## Display Options
In the example above, both of the elements are inlined in the message. Chainlit provides three options to display elements:
- `inline` (embedded in the message)
- `side` (the element will be displayed in a side panel)
- `page` (the element will be displayed in a dedicated page)

## Side example
By changing the text element display mode from the previous example, the element name becomes clickable and opens in a side panel:

```python Code Example
send_text(text="Here is a text element", name="text1", display="side")
```
