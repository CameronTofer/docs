title: Ask Element
---

The ask element is used to ask the user for a file.

```python Code Example
import chainlit as cl

@cl.on_chat_start
def start():
    file = None

    # Wait for the user to upload a file
    while file == None:
        file = cl.ask_for_file(
            title="Please upload a text file to begin!", accept=["text/plain"])

    # Decode the file
    text = file.content.decode("utf-8")
```

## Result
