title: "Send Elements"
---

Elements are pieces of data (text, images, etc.) that are sent to and received from the user interface. Chainlit provides a number of methods for sending and receiving elements, which are described in detail below.

Chainlit provides methods for sending elements to the user interface:

1. **send_local_image**: This function sends a local image to the chatbot UI. You can find the detailed documentation [here](/api-reference/send-local-image).

2. **send_text**: This function sends a text element to the chatbot UI. You can find the detailed documentation [here](/api-reference/send-text).

These methods allow you to send various types of elements, such as images and text files, and control how they are displayed in the UI.
If your element type is not yet supported, let us know on the Chainlit Discord!
