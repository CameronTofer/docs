  The unique identifier for the action, used to reference the action within the
  chatbot.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="value" type="str">
  The value associated with the action. This is useful to differentiate between
  multiple actions with the same name.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="description" type="str" optional>
  A short, descriptive text for the action, used to provide additional
  information about the action to the user.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="forId" type="str" optional>
  The optional target element identifier to which the action is bound. You
  should not use this parameter.
</ParamField>

### Usage

```python Code Example
import chainlit as cl
from chainlit import Action

def on_action(action):
    cl.send_message(f"Executed {action.name}")
    # Optionally remove the action button from the chatbot user interface
