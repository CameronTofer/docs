title: "langchain_factory"
---
Plug and play decorator for the LangChain library.  

The decorated function should instantiate a new LangChain instance (Chain, Agent...). One instance per user session is created and cached. The per user instance is called every time a new message is received.

<RequestExample>
```python Code Example
from langchain import OpenAI, LLMMathChain
from chainlit import langchain_factory

@langchain_factory
def load():
    llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
    llm_math = LLMMathChain(llm=llm)
    return llm_math
```
