Here is an example on how to ask a user to upload a text file:

```python
from chainlit import on_chat_start, ask_for_file

@on_chat_start
def start():
    file = None

    # Wait for the user to upload a file
    while file == None:
        file = ask_for_file(
            title="Please upload a text file to begin!", accept=["text/plain"])

    # Decode the file
    text = file.content.decode("utf-8")
```

## Result
