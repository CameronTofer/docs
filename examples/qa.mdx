Example inspired from the [LangChain doc](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/question_answering.html)

<Note>This example has extra dependencies, such as `chromadb`. You might have to install them manually.</Note>

<Note>The state of the union file is available [here](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/blob/master/docs/modules/state_of_the_union.txt)</Note>

We are making use of the [@langchain_factory](/api-reference/langchain-factory) decorator to tell Chainlit on how to get the LangChain agent.
Then, we use [@langchain_postprocess](/api-reference/langchain-postprocess) (which takes the raw response from the agent) as well as [send_text](/api-reference/send-text) to:
- Add the relevant sources to the final answer
- Send the sources to the UI

## Try it out

```bash
$ chainlit run qa.py
```

You can then upload any `.txt` file to the UI and ask questions about it.
If you are using `state_of_the_union.txt` you can ask questions like `What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson`.
