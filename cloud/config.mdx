title: Config
---

When running `chainlit run ...` for the first time, a toml config file will automatically be generated.

```toml config.toml
[project]
# Name of the app and chatbot.
name = "Chatbot"

# If true (default), the app will be available to anonymous users (once deployed).
# If false, users will need to authenticate and be part of the project to use the app.
public = true

# The project ID (found on https://cloud.chainlit.io).
# If provided, all the message data will be stored in the cloud.
# The project ID is required when public is set to false.
#id = ""

# List of environment variables to be provided by each user to use the app.
user_env = []

[env]
# Environment variables to be loaded.
#OPENAI_API_KEY = "..."
```

<Note>If you do not see that config file, run `chainlit init` at the root of your app.</Note>

## Adding your project ID

In that file, under `[project]`, uncomment the id property and paste the project ID you obtained in the previous section:
```toml
id = "test-MbHXZmUMAnxX"
```

## Restart your app
After restarting your app, and logging in if not already, you should see new elements in the ui:
- The dataset tab, where you can find your persisted conversations
- The history button in the chat input (you can also press the `up arrow` to open it)
