---

Chainlit turns your python code into a chatbot UI in a few lines of code.

```python app.py
import chainlit as cl

@cl.on_message # this function will be called every time a user inputs a message in the UI
def main(message: str):

    # your custom logic...

    # send back a reply to the user
    cl.send_message(
      content=f"Received: {message}",
    )
```

That's it. Run the following command to start the chatbot UI.

```bash
$ chainlit run app.py -w
```

Congratulations, your first chainlit app is ready ðŸ¥³
