---

Chainlit can turn your python code into a chatbot in a few lines of code.

```python
from chainlit import send_message, on_message

@on_message # this function will be called every time a user inputs a message in the UI
def main(message: str):

    # custom logic...

    # send back a reply to the user
    send_message(
      content=f"Received: {message}",
    )
```

Now just run:

```bash
chainlit run app.py -w
```

Congratulations, you built your first chainlit app ðŸ¥³
