title: Environment Variables
---

Hardcoding API keys in your code is not a good practice. It makes your code less portable and less flexible. It also makes it harder to keep your code secure. Instead, you should use environment variables to store values that are specific to your development environment.

Chainlit will automatically load environment variables from a `.env` file in the root of your project. This file should be added to your `.gitignore` file so that it is not committed to your repository.
