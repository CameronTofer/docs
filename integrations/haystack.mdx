Haystack is an end-to-end NLP framework that enables you to build NLP applications powered by LLMs, Transformer models, vector search and more. Whether you want to perform question answering, answer generation, semantic document search, or build tools that are capable of complex decision making and query resolution, you can use the state-of-the-art NLP models with Haystack to build end-to-end NLP applications solving your use case.
Check out their repo: https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack.

## Integration


<CodeGroup>

```python Code Example
import chainlit as cl

## Some code

agent = ConversationalAgent(
  prompt_node=conversational_agent_prompt_node,
  memory=memory,
  prompt_template=agent_prompt,
  tools=[search_tool],
)
cl.HaystackAgentCallbackHandler(agent)
```
</CodeGroup>

This code adds the Chainlit callback handler to the Haystack callback manager.
The callback handler is responsible for listening to the chain's intermediate steps and sending them to the UI.
