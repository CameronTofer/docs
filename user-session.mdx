title: User Session
---
`user_session` is a dictionary that stores the user's session data. The `id` and `env` keys are reserved for the session ID and environment variables, respectively. If you are using **langchain_factory**, the `agent` key will also be available. Other keys can be used to store arbitrary data in the user's session.

`user_session` has two methods: `get` and `set`. The `get` method retrieves a value from the user's session. The `set` method sets a value in the user's session.

To use the `user_session`, first import it:

```python
from chainlit import user_session
```

To get a value from the user's session, call the `get` method:

```python
value = user_session.get(key)
```

The `key` parameter is a string that identifies the value to retrieve. If the key is not found in the user's session, `None` is returned.

To set a value in the user's session, call the `set` method:

```python
user_session.set(key, value)
```

The `key` parameter is a string that identifies the value to set. The `value` parameter is the value to set in the user's session.
