## Introduction
Chainlit is an open-source Python package that aims to make LLM-based agents explainable, debuggable, and shareable.


It revolutionizes the developer experience by offering a user interface that streamlines interaction with agents, allowing developers to create transparent and efficient AI applications with ease.

## Advantages of Chainlit
1. **Enhanced explainability:** With Chainlit's user interface, you can visualize the agent's [Chain of Thought](https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/05/language-models-perform-reasoning-via.html), enabling you to understand its decision-making process and gain deeper insights into how it works.

2. **Debugging made easy:** Chainlit's prompt playground allows you to iterate on intermediate prompts and see their effect on the agent's output, making it easier to identify and fix issues in your agent.

3. **Seamless file management:** The package includes a set of functions to ask and send files or documents, simplifying the process of handling and sharing data with your AI agent.

4. **Free deployment:** Chainlit offers free deployment, allowing you to quickly and easily share your AI applications with your team or the world.

5. **Plug and play integration with LangChain:** Chainlit seamlessly integrates with LangChain, further enhancing the capabilities of your LLM-based agents.

6. **Improved team collaboration:** Chainlit's features, such as data persistence, human feedback, and prompt versioning, enable your team to work together more effectively and efficiently, leading to better AI applications.
