title: Migration Guide to Chainlit v0.7.0
---

## Updating Chainlit

Begin the migration by updating Chainlit to the latest version:

```bash
pip install --upgrade chainlit
```

Then remove your `.chainlit/config.toml` file and regenerate it:

```bash
chainlit init
```

Several fields disappeared from the config, such as `project_id`, `public` and `database`.

## Authentication

Previously, authentication was completely tied to Chainlit Cloud and not customizable by the developers.
The new system enables developer to quickly implement:

- login/password authentication
- OAuth authentication
- Header based authentication for apps running with a reverse proxy.

Check the [documentation](/authentication) to learn more about it.

## Data Persistence

Previously Chainlit was allowing for different database mode (`cloud`, `local` and `custom`). We found that it was confusing for developers and that some modes were heavily misused (like `local` db in production).

The new system is much simpler. You can create an API key on [Chainlit Cloud](https://cloud.chainlit.io/). Then set it in your `.env` and you are good to go.

We understand that data privacy is a concern for companies, that's why we made Chainlit Cloud self hostable.

Check the [documentation](/cloud/persistence) to learn more about it.

## Removed APIs

The following APIs have been **removed**:

- `@cl.auth_client` (see new authentication)
- `@cl.db_client` (see new data persistence)

## Resources

The documentation, [examples](/examples), and [cookbook](https://github.com/Chainlit/cookbook) have been updated to reflect the new APIs. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZThrUxbAYw) server.
