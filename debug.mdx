title: Debug prompts
---

As your app becomes more complex (Chain of Thoughts, LangChain...), understanding how a specific answer has been generated becomes painful.
To address that issue, Chainlit introduced the `Show steps` button.

Here is a screenshot from the [LangChain MRKL](/examples/mrkl) example:

We can see that several intermediate steps are required to answer the original question.
Being able to scroll through the steps in the UI is helpful, but being able to iterate on the prompt of each step on the fly is even more powerful.  

That is exactly what the `edit button` is for. Clicking on it opens a prompt playground where you can modify and iterate on the prompt:
